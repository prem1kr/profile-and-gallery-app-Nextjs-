        Thank you for giving me this opportunity.
        My name is <span className="text-white font-semibold">Prem Kumar</span>, 
        and I’m from <span className="text-white">Aurangabad, Bihar</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve recently completed my <span className="text-white">Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering</span> 
        from <span className="text-white">Chandigarh Engineering College</span>. 
        During my academic journey, I developed a strong interest in 
        <span className="text-white"> full-stack web development</span> 
        and gained hands-on experience with modern technologies such as 
        <span className="text-white"> HTML</span>, <span className="text-white">CSS</span>, 
        <span className="text-white"> JavaScript</span>, <span className="text-white">React</span>, 
        <span className="text-white">Node.js</span>, <span className="text-white">Express.js</span>, 
        and <span className="text-white">MongoDB</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also had the opportunity to work in a collaborative team environment during my internship 
        at <span className="text-white">ThinkNEXT Technologies Pvt. Ltd.</span>, where I contributed to the 
        end-to-end development of real-world projects, including an 
        <span className="text-white"> e-commerce website</span> and a 
        <span className="text-white"> fintech platform</span>. 
        These experiences helped me strengthen my problem-solving abilities, 
        teamwork, and project management skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about building scalable, user-friendly applications and 
        continuously improving my technical and creative abilities. 
        I’m eager to apply my knowledge in a professional environment and 
        contribute to innovative projects.
